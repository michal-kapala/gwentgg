# Gwent.gg
Personal game history browser for Gwent. Inspired by [op.gg](https://www.op.gg/).

## How to use
You need your GOG user ID and personal API access token.

### User ID
For Windows:
1. Select `Run` from `Start` menu.
2. Paste `"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\CD Projekt Red\REDlauncher\config\launcher.ini"`.
3. Copy the value next to `lastKnownUserId`.
4. Paste it as the value of `user_id` in this app's `config.json`.

### Access token
As of now you need to use the access token generated by the game.

A guide on how to get your token is available [here](https://gist.github.com/michal-kapala/e7ef52c9b50a5861bf93e3851537816b).

Your access token is valid for 1 hour. Gwent will automatically refresh it after 55min, so you can simply copy it and log in again.

## Disclaimer
This app interacts directly with Gwent's APIs using your GOG account.

Any abuse can be traced back and eventually result in a ban and/or other punishment, for which the authors take no responsibility. Use with common sense.
